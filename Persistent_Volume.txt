Persistent Volumes

1. I have deployed a POD. Inspect the POD and wait for it to start running.

2. The application stores logs at location /log/app.log. View the logs.
You can exec in to the container and open the file:
kubectl exec webapp -- cat /log/app.log

3. If the POD was to get deleted now, would you be able to view these logs?

4. Configure a volume to store these logs at /var/log/webapp on the host.
Use the spec provided below.
Name: webapp
Image Name: kodekloud/event-simulator
Volume HostPath: /var/log/webapp
Volume Mount: /log
      
5. Create a Persistent Volume with the given specification
Volume Name: pv-log
Storage: 100Mi
Access Modes: ReadWriteMany
Host Path: /pv/log
Reclaim Policy: Retain


6. Let us claim some of that storage for our application. Create a Persistent Volume Claim with the given specification.
Volume Name: claim-log-1
Storage Request: 50Mi
Access Modes: ReadWriteOnce


7. What is the state of the Persistent Volume Claim?

8. Why is the claim not bound to the available Persistent Volume?

9. Update the Access Mode on the claim to bind it to the PV.
Delete and recreate the claim-log-1.
Volume Name: claim-log-1
Storage Request: 50Mi
PVol: pv-log
Status: Bound
      
10. You requested for 50Mi, how much capacity is now available to the PVC?

11. Update the webapp pod to use the persistent volume claim as its storage.
Replace hostPath configured earlier with the newly created PersistentVolumeClaim.

Name: webapp
Image Name: kodekloud/event-simulator
Volume: PersistentVolumeClaim=claim-log-1
Volume Mount: /log
      
12. What is the Reclaim Policy set on the Persistent Volume pv-log?

13. What would happen to the PV if the PVC was destroyed?

14. Try deleting the PVC and notice what happens.

15. Why is the PVC stuck in Terminating state?

16. Let us now delete the webapp Pod.
Once deleted, wait for the pod to fully terminate.

17. What is the state of the PVC now?

18. What is the state of the Persistent Volume now?

19. Create a the same volumeclaim claim-log-1 using the ionos storageclass

20. Do you think is a good idea to store the files on the node storage?

21. Check if it gets created

22. Check if it is bound? If, not why?

23. Create a pod using the claim

24. Check the node where the pod is running

25. Check the node on DCD

26. delete the pod after that the pvc 

27. What happens with the persistent volume?
