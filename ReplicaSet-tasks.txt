ReplicaSet

1. How many PODs exist on the system?
In the current(default) namespace.

2. How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?
In the current(default) namespace.

3. How about now? How many ReplicaSets do you see?
        
4. How many PODs are DESIRED in the new-replica-set?

5. What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set?

6. How many PODs are READY in the new-replica-set?

7. Why do you think the PODs are not ready?

8. Delete any one of the 4 PODs.

9. How many PODs exist now?

10. Why are there still 4 PODs, even after you deleted one?

11. Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definition-1.yaml file.
There is an issue with the file, so try to fix it.

12. Fix the issue in the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file and create a ReplicaSet using it.
        
13. Delete the two newly created ReplicaSets - replicaset-1 and replicaset-2

14. Fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image.
Either delete and recreate the ReplicaSet or Update the existing ReplicaSet and then delete all PODs, so new ones with the correct image will be created.

15. Scale the ReplicaSet to 5 PODs.
Use kubectl scale command or edit the replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.

16. Now scale the ReplicaSet down to 2 PODs.
Use the kubectl scale command or edit the replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.
